When mentioning financial investing, most people would first think of stocks. While stocks are one of the most popular investment instruments for retail investors, it is only the tip of the iceberg. As retail investors, I think its important to also be away of other types of financial assets, even if you don't plan on investing in them. So lets see what else is out there...

### Types of Financial Assets

Figure 1: Types of financial assets [1]

Here is a good way I found to visualize how it all breaks down. We have two general categories: direct and indirect investing.

### Direct Investing

As the name suggest, direct investing is when investors choose to directly buy a security, whether thats stocks, bonds, or derivative contracts (more on this later). This allows investors to have high levels of control over their investments and offer the highest potential returns. However, the risk associated with this is also generally higher as it requires the knowledge and expertise of the investor to make optimal decisions. In Figure 1, direct investing is further categorized depending on the time horizon (ie. the length of time an investor expects to hold the investment before needing to sell/liquidate it) of the investment.

### Money Markets

These are short term debt instuments (ie. you are lending money to another party, aka buying their debt) issued by governments, banks, and large corporations. Their main characteristic is that they have maturities of a year or less, meaning you can expect returns within a year. Money markets are relatively risk free as its issued by trusted parties and have short time horizons.

As retail investors, its typically difficult to directly invest in money market securites since they typically have large minimum transactions ($100,000+). So instead, its common to invest in money market funds which pools the investments of many investors together.

Some examples include Treasury Bills (issued by the government), Certificates of Deposits (issued by banks and financial institutions), and Commercial Papers (issued by corporations).

### Capital Markets

This is what most people would be familiar with and includes instruments with maturities greater than one year. Capital markets can be further broken down depending on whether the instrument contains a promised set of cash returns over time (fixed income market), or offer a stake in the future profits of a company (equity market)...

#### Fixed Income

Similar to money markets, fixed income securities are debt issued by governments and corporations. They offer pre-determined payment schedules. The most common example is bonds, which (sometimes) offer consistant interest payments at specified dates, then the repayment of the initial investment at another date. Bonds are a big topic, so maybe I'll write a blog specifically on it in the future.

#### Equity

Stocks... Equity instruments are investments directly into a company and by doing so, you will also own a part of that company. Stocks usually have no maturity date, and offer no consistant payments (there are some stocks that offer higher dividends too...). Depending on the stock, it can also be highly volatile and generally requires knowledge of the company and the overall market to be successful in the long term. Or, you could just be lucky

### Derivatives

### Indirect Investing

Indirect investing offers a relatively hands off and risk free approach. It adds a layer of abstraction on top of direct investing methods. So instead of buying an individual stock, you will invest in shares of an asset portfolio which bundles together a set of direct investments. These portfolios are often very diversivied and offer consistant returns over the long term. But you also wont be seeing any crazy gains. On top of that, many direct investing methods also charge FEES... anywhere from 0.5%-2.5% from what I've seen, depending on the type of fund.

Some examples of indirect investing methods include mutual funds, index funds, and ETFs (exchange traded funds).

Mutual funds offer highly managed portfolios, often released by banks and other financial institutions. They also charge the highest fees, I've seen some that are around 2% of investments annually.

Index funds and ETFs are my main choice of long term investments. They offer benefits of other indirect investing methods, while having low fees (~0.5%). This is because they are usually not actively managed and instead track a market index or other financial security (such as gold or crypto). Perfect for the lazy investor.

There are also other financial assets such as real estate and foreign exchange... but thats a topic for another day (perhaps)

Investing is the tradeoff between risk and potential returns. The higher the potential returns, the higher the risk.
