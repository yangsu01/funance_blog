When I just got started with investing, one of the things I learned about is the allocation of assets. Generally speaking for retail investors, there are 2 asset classes that are available to invest in:

- Equity, primarily in the form of stocks
- Fixed income, primarily in the form of bonds

I learned about the need for choosing a proper asset allocation depending on your age and level of risk you are willing to take. Whether thats an 80-20 for younger people, or a less risky 40-60 split if you are nearing your retirement.

Nowadays for passive investors, its even more carefree as you can just invest in a single basket ETF with your desired allocation, whether thats VGRO or VCNS (I'm Canadian so these are traded on TSE...). You don't even need to rebalance your portfolio anymore. Despite this, I still think its important to have a basic understanding of these assets.

To me, while stocks have always been relatively straightforward to understand, bonds were a bit more illusive. Why are they considered 'safer'? What drives their prices to change? What can we learn from bond prices?

Lets try to answer these questions in this weeks edition of **Funance Blog**

## 1 What are Bonds

There are many websites and blogs that explain this already, so to paraphrase, bonds are basically loans issued by governments or companies. But unlike your car insurance or mortgage, you can trade it in the market. They are not directly traded on the stock market (you can find bond ETFs tho) but can be bought directly through a bank or broker.

Bonds are consider safer than stocks because...

- Longer term bonds often have consistent payouts throughout its lifetime (coupons)
- The principle, ie, the initial amount you buy is guaranteed to be paid back when the bond matures (unless the company or country goes bankrupt at which, theres probably more things to worry about...)
- Companies will pay out bond holder before stock holders (so even if they go under, at least theres still people doing worse than you)
- Bonds are less volatile than stocks. While stock prices can change drastically, bond yields are fixed (although the bond price might change, but if you hold the bond till maturity, it's all good).

Generally, government bonds are considered the safest which is also what we will be looking at today.

Before moving forward, lets clarify some of the important terms related to bonds:

- `Maturity` - the time period when the bond issuer must pay back the bond value to the bondholder. Can range from a few months to decades.
- `PAR` - aka the face value of the bond. It is the amount of money the bond issuer will repay the bondholder
- `Coupon rate` - the annual or semi-annual amount of money that the issuer will pay to the holder up until maturity. Kinda like periodic interest payments (Canadian government bonds have semi-annual payouts). Coupon rate is predetermined and will not change.
- `Yield` - Similar to expected returns on stocks. The annualized rate of return on a bond
- `Yield to Maturity` - The total expected return of a bond if it is held to maturity.
