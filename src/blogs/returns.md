# Returns

Returns are an easy way of looking at how much profit (or loss) a stock has generated over a certain period of time

The *net returns* over a certain period can be calculated as:

$$
    R_t = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1  =  \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}
$$

where $R_t$ is the net returns, $P_t$ is the price of a stock, at time $t$, and $P_{t-1}$ is the price at the beginning of the period. 

If we set $t$ to be now, and $t-1$ to be when the initial investment was made, we can easily find the total returns of our holding
